- name: Distance Detection with Stationary Computer Vision
  descr: "The goal of this project is to develop an accurate, low-cost, low energy model for finding multiple objects through cameras paired with computer vision. Existing approaches for distance detection focus on parallax or sonar with visible light, or infrared lasers, which are expensive or close ranged. Other approaches focus on highly trained neural network systems that require tremendous amounts of data and energy.I present a method that uses two aligned cameras with object detection, creating a more accessible approach that relies less on the quality of the device and/or the trained machine learning model. Using Googleâ€™s Mediapipe for computer vision and two web-cameras, this method managed to achieve high success rates within three tests. This technology was tested with ROS2 and other computer vision technology, proving it to be a good, efficient component in robotic systems."
